=========================================================

This project provides first-class OAuth library support for `Requests <http://python-requests.org>`_.

The OAuth 1 workflow
--------------------

OAuth 1 can seem overly complicated and it sure has its quirks. Luckily,
requests_oauthlib hides most of these and let you focus at the task at hand.

Accessing protected resources using requests_oauthlib is as simple as:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from requests_oauthlib import OAuth1Session
    >>> twitter = OAuth1Session('client_key',
                                client_secret='client_secret',
                                resource_owner_key='resource_owner_key',
                                resource_owner_secret='resource_owner_secret')
    >>> url = 'https://api.twitter.com/1/account/settings.json'
    >>> r = twitter.get(url)

Before accessing resources you will need to obtain a few credentials from your
provider (i.e. Twitter) and authorization from the user for whom you wish to
retrieve resources for. You can read all about this in the full
`OAuth 1 workflow guide on RTD <http://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth1_workflow.html>`_.

The OAuth 2 workflow
--------------------

OAuth 2 is generally simpler than OAuth 1 but comes in more flavours. The most
common being the Authorization Code Grant, also known as the WebApplication
flow.

Fetching a protected resource after obtaining an access token can be extremely
simple. However, before accessing resources you will need to obtain a few
credentials from your provider (i.e. Google) and authorization from the user
for whom you wish to retrieve resources for. You can read all about this in the
full `OAuth 2 workflow guide on RTD <http://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth2_workflow.html>`_.

History
-------

v0.8.0 (14 February 2017)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Added Fitbit compliance fix.
- Fixed an issue where newlines in the response body for the access token
  request would cause errors when trying to extract the token.
- Fixed an issue introduced in v0.7.0 where users passing ``auth`` to several
  methods would encounter conflicts with the ``client_id`` and
  ``client_secret``-derived auth. The user-supplied ``auth`` argument is now
  used in preference to those options.

v0.7.0 (22 September 2016)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Allowed ``OAuth2Session.request`` to take the ``client_id`` and
  ``client_secret`` parameters for the purposes of automatic token refresh,
  which may need them.

v0.6.2 (12 July 2016)
+++++++++++++++++++++

- Use ``client_id`` and ``client_secret`` for the Authorization header if
  provided.
- Allow explicit bypass of the Authorization header by setting ``auth=False``.
- Pass through the ``proxies`` kwarg when refreshing tokens.
- Miscellaneous cleanups.

v0.6.1 (19 February 2016)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed a bug when sending authorization in headers with no username and
  password present.
- Make sure we clear the session token before obtaining a new one.
- Some improvements to the Slack compliance fix.
- Avoid timing problems around token refresh.
- Allow passing arbitrary arguments to requests when calling
  ``fetch_request_token`` and ``fetch_access_token``.

v0.6.0 (14 December 2015)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Add compliance fix for Slack.
- Add compliance fix for Mailchimp.
- ``TokenRequestDenied`` exceptions now carry the entire response, not just the
  status code.
- Pass through keyword arguments when refreshing tokens automatically.
- Send authorization in headers, not just body, to maximize compatibility.
- More getters/setters available for OAuth2 session client values.
- Allow sending custom headers when refreshing tokens, and set some defaults.


v0.5.0 (4 May 2015)
+++++++++++++++++++
- Fix ``TypeError`` being raised instead of ``TokenMissing`` error.
- Raise requests exceptions on 4XX and 5XX responses in the OAuth2 flow.
- Avoid ``AttributeError`` when initializing the ``OAuth2Session`` class
  without complete client information.

v0.4.2 (16 October 2014)
++++++++++++++++++++++++
- New ``authorized`` property on OAuth1Session and OAuth2Session, which allows
  you to easily determine if the session is already authorized with OAuth tokens
  or not.
- New ``TokenMissing`` and ``VerifierMissing`` exception classes for OAuth1Session:
  this will make it easier to catch and identify these exceptions.

v0.4.1 (6 June 2014)
++++++++++++++++++++
- New install target ``[rsa]`` for people using OAuth1 RSA-SHA1 signature
  method.
- Fixed bug in OAuth2 where supplied state param was not used in auth url.
- OAuth2 HTTPS checking can be disabled by setting environment variable
  ``OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT``.
- OAuth1 now re-authorize upon redirects.
- OAuth1 token fetching now raise a detailed error message when the
  response body is incorrectly encoded or the request was denied.
- Added support for custom OAuth1 clients.
- OAuth2 compliance fix for Sina Weibo.
- Multiple fixes to facebook compliance fix.
- Compliance fixes now re-encode body properly as bytes in Python 3.
- Logging now properly done under ``requests_oauthlib`` namespace instead
  of piggybacking on oauthlib namespace.
- Logging introduced for OAuth1 auth and session.

v0.4.0 (29 September 2013)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- OAuth1Session methods only return unicode strings. #55.
- Renamed requests_oauthlib.core to requests_oauthlib.oauth1_auth for consistency. #79.
- Added Facebook compliance fix and access_token_response hook to OAuth2Session. #63.
- Added LinkedIn compliance fix.
- Added refresh_token_response compliance hook, invoked before parsing the refresh token.
- Correctly limit compliance hooks to running only once!
- Content type guessing should only be done when no content type is given
- OAuth1 now updates r.headers instead of replacing it with non case insensitive dict
- Remove last use of Response.content (in OAuth1Session). #44.
- State param can now be supplied in OAuth2Session.authorize_url
